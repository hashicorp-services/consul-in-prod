## What's Inside

This book provides to <strong>customer-facing implementers</strong> hands-on end-to-end instructions about automation to create -- for <strong>production</strong> usage -- secure and highly-available implementations of HashiCorp Consul with Vault common within Global 2000 enterprises.

The most common usage of Consul is a "Global Network Mesh" which is a superset of the industry concept of "Service Mesh". Unlike others which operate only in Kubernetes or only in AWS, 
Consul provides <a href="#multi-region">multi-region reliability</a>, <a href="#Clouds">multi-cloud flexibility</a>, and <a href="#OS-Platforms">multi-platform adaptability</a>.

So this document is focused how to create such amazing capabilities.

<a name="Editions"></a>

## Editions of Consul

Consul is available in several editions :

   * Free Open-Source (at https://github.com/hashicorp/consul)
   * Licensed Enterprise (installed, configured, and managed by enterprise customers)
   * Licensed HCP cloud Consul (using HVN setup within the customer's app infrastructure)
   <br /><br />

Because most enterprises want support contracts, this document is focused on enterprise use in production, and does not cover setting up of an individual stand-alone Consul cluster for purpose of learning.

HashiCorp maintains the cloud edition of Consul, Enterprise, and Terraform.

### Multi-Region Production Scope

<a name="TheApp"></a>

## The App/System Managed by Consul

An app is needed for Consul to manage.
This document makes use of the HashiCups sample app maintained by HashiCorp.

Although Consul works with multiple platform technologies, a Linux-based sample e-commerce application (HashiCups?) running in Kubernetes with a server node for each of these APIs:
   * front-end web server
   * product
   * shipment
   * payment (external)
   <br /><br />

   (Not included are Redis cache, Elastisearch (parse logs), mail/SMS, ratings, observability, analytics, etc.)<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/ecommerce-website-running-in-secured-ase">*</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/scalable-ecommerce-web-app">*</a>

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1652637715/consul-svc-regis-1584x1552_jnnu9g.png"><img align="right" alt="Registry" width="200" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1652637715/consul-svc-regis-1584x1552_jnnu9g.png"></a>
A key capability of Consul is that, as each app service is instantiated, Consul detects it and adds it to its Service Registry, then securely route network traffic to them, even across disparate platforms (via a Consul API Gateway).

Consul provides the "glue" to services across the enterprise.


<a name="GlobalMesh"></a>

## Consul Global Network Mesh

Within enterprises, each app exists in a sea of other apps and systems.

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1652200423/consult-multi-envoy-1734x972_ymgi7l.png"><img align="right" alt="consul with envoy" width="200" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1652200423/consult-multi-envoy-1734x972_ymgi7l.png"></a>
In each app server node, a Consul sidecar enables a <strong>Consul Global Network Mesh</strong> which directs L4 (network level 4) traffic across multiple clouds operating different platform technologies:
<ul>
A. Among app nodes within the same app cluster<br />
B. Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) outside Kubernetes<br />
C. AWS EC2 image running in AWS<br />
D. AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hashicorp.com/events/webinars/how-comcast-runs-consul-service-mesh-on-amazon-ecs">VID</a><br />
E. AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) with Service Mesh <br />
F. VMWare registry image of hypervisor communicating with Kubernetes<br />
G. Pivotal Cloud Foundary<br />
H. RedHat OpenShift<br />
I. Serverless (AWS Lambda, Azure & GCP Functions) running within clouds<br />
</ul>

   * The Consul Docker container is retrieved into <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/kubernetes-reference-architecture">Kubernetes</a>.
   <br /><br />

Thus, Consul "future proofs" how enterprises securely manage networking between services.


<a name="ConsulFeatures"></a>

## HashiCorp products and features used

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1658153413/app-east-west-968x897_nspfgj.png"><img align="right" alt="app layers" width="200" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1658153413/app-east-west-968x897_nspfgj.png"></a> 
This document defines the features of Consul and Vault implemented :

   1. <strong>Centralized identity-based authentication</strong> for users and service accounts (with SSO and MFA using Okta OIDC IdP and other Authentication Methods)
   1. <strong>Centralized secrets</strong> management (using Vault)
   1. <strong>Encryption</strong> of app data in transit and at rest (using Vault)
   
   1. Segregation of app data into different <strong>data Namespaces</strong> to reduce access to data in case of breach (which we assume will occur)
   1. <strong>Admin partitions</strong> in a centralized service registry in the Consul Key/Value store - (this is the core feature desired by most enterprises)

   1. <strong>Segmentation of network</strong> traffic to restrict network access in case of breach (which we assume will occur)
   1. <strong>Layer 7 Traffic Managment</strong> for Canary testing, A/B tests, blue/green deploys, and soft multi-tenancy (instead of "East/West" Load Balancers among microservices)
   1. Use of Access Control Lists (<strong>ACLs</strong> tokens) to enforce least-privilege access
   
   1. <strong>Read replicas</strong> to ensure performance and reliability as systems scale
   1. <strong>Automated backups</strong> to ensure quick and reliable recovery in case of disaster at app, cloud Availability Zone, and cloud region levels (for MTTR to meet RPO and RTO standards)
   1. <strong>Autopilot Enterprise Redundancy Zones</strong> to improve resiliency and scaling by adding “non-voting” servers which will be promoted to voting status in case of voting server failure.
   1. <strong>Automated upgrades</strong> of versions

<a name="Clouds"></a>

## Clouds

This presents procedures and automation for creating Consul within each cloud:

Scripts to install assets for Instruqt labs may be used in production scripts.

1. <strong>AWS</strong> is the most popular cloud.

   * https://github.com/hashicorp-services/accelerator-aws-consul/ (internal) by Implementation Services (Kyle Rarey, Austin Workman) contains scripts used on customer sites

   * https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul-starter by the Operations Experience team (Omar Khawaja and Sara Chandler) is deprecated.
   <br /><br />

1. <strong>Google (GCP)</strong> - HashiCorp's hands-on Instruqt labs run on GCP. 

   * https://github.com/hashicorp/field-workshops-consul by Thomas Kula (PreSales Solutions Engineering) has slides for aws, azure, gcp, multi-cloud. Has an instructor guide to Instruqt tracks.

   * https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-instruqt contains source files for interactive scenarios at https://learn.hashicorp.com
   * https://github.com/hashicorp-services/enablement-consul-instruqt
   * https://github.com/hashicorp-services/enablement-vault-instruqt

   * https://github.com/hashicorp-services/accelerator-gcp-consul/ doesn't exist yet
   <br /><br />

1. <strong>Azure</strong>

   * https://github.com/hashicorp-services/accelerator-azure-consul/ doesn't exist yet

   * https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-azure-consul-ent-starter by the Operations Experience team (Omar Khawaja and Sara Chandler) is deprecated.
   <br /><br />

NOTE: We aim to structure our implementation scripts to make it easier to customize across different clouds.

## OS Platforms

Each implementation has an edition/variation for each technical platform:

* MacOS is commonly used on laptop clients used by developers and administrators.

* Linux (Ubuntu RedHat)
<br /><br />


<a name="DevSecOps"></a>

## DevSecOps Workflow

Our objective is that, after initial install and configuration, minimal manual intervention be required to keep Consul running.

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/devsecops-infrastructure-as-code"><img align="right" alt="Azure CI/CD" width="200" src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/media/devsecops-for-iac.png"></a> 
To save time, enable collaboration, ensure repeatability, and avoid mistakes, the <a name="ConsulFeatures">Consul features above</a> are instantiated using <strong>modern DevSecOps principles</strong>:

<a name="Proving"></a>

## Proof of Production Viability

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1652579825/consul-promote-in-az-550x342_a87mri.png"><img align="right" alt="promotion" width="200" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1652579825/consul-promote-in-az-550x342_a87mri.png"></a>
We also provide procedures and automation to <strong>prove</strong> that production-grade mechanisms can actually respond effectively to various stresses (planned and unplanned outages):

   1. ACL blocks access to those not authorized
   1. As each new service comes online, Consul "discovers" them
   1. Nodes auto-starts and re-joins its cluster when appropriate
   1. When a service becomes unhealthy, Consul no longer routes traffic to it

   1. When ACL and Intentions are changed, access is immediately restricted or allowed
   1. Data associated with each change is propagated (via Serf Gossip protocol) among nodes
   1. Each change that occurs in Consul results in notification of network management systems (Palo Alto via NIA CTS)

   1. When a Follower node is no longer functional, others continue working
   1. When the Leader node is no longer functional, the Raft protocol establishes a new Leader
   1. Additional cloud resources are added or removed as demand rises or drops significantly

   1. Logs can be filtered for troubleshooting (using Datadog and other observability tools)
   1. Dashboards (using Grafana) display analytics about key trends    
   1. Alerts are issued when trouble is recognized (due to injection of troubling events)
