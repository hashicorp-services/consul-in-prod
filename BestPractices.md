Like ITIL, PMI, SAFe, etc., the Well-Architected Framework provides <a href="#CommonDefinitions">"industry-standard" common terminology</a> for concepts.

Knowledge about WA (best practices) is <strong>tested for</strong> in <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/aws-certs">AWS certification exams</a>.

AWS organized their hands-on tutorials to each of the WAF Pillars in their <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/well-architected-cloud/#aws-well-architected-labs">WellArchitectedLabs.com</a>.
Each tutorial shows only how AWS tools are used (Cloud9, CloudFormation, etc.).
This is how Amazon get people to use their tooling rather than alternatives such as Terraform, Vault, etc.

Vendors offering alternative tools would need their own tutorials on their own websites.

## What is it? Overview

On the surface, the "Well Architected Framework" (WAF) is a bunch of <strong>open-ended questions</strong> such as:

   * How do you manage permissions for people and machines?
   <br /><br />

But each question is a rephrasing of a <strong>best practice category</strong> such as:

   * Manage permissions for people and machines
   <br /><br />

For each question are <strong>considerations</strong> such as:

   * Define access requirements
   * Grant least privilege access 
   <br /><br />

Considerations include <strong>specific recommendations</strong> such as:

   * Have a clear definition of who or what should have access to each component, choose the appropriate identity type and method of authentication and authorization.
   * Grant only the access that identities require by allowing access to specific actions on specific AWS resources under specific conditions.
   <br /><br />

PROTIP: To self-designate your organization and systems assets "<strong>Well Architected By Design (WABD)</strong>", convert WAF recommendations into <strong>verifiable statements</strong>. 

   * Our ____ document defines who or what should have access to each component, which specifies the appropriate identity type and method of authentication and authorization.
   * We use <strong>Consul's ACL features</strong> to grant only the access that identities require by allowing access to specific actions on specific resources under specific conditions.
   <br /><br />

Such statements -- and <strong>evidence</strong> that prove their actual usage over time -- can then be used as the basis for obtaining annual <strong>attestations from auditor</strong> based on <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/soc2">SOC2</a>, ISO 2700, FedRamp, etc.

> WAF questions are grouped into several <a href="#Pillars">"pillars"</a> which <strong>comprehensively cover</strong> all major aspects of Information Technology in the cloud, not just security. And WAF covers the entire lifecycle of apps and data.


## Why?

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbIQ2eRJY0g" title="Aug 11, 2021">Why? Potential benefits</a> sound like what is claimed for every product:

   * Build and deploy faster
   * Lower or mitigate risks
   * Make more informed decisions
   * Learn best practices
   * Improve the quality of workloads
   <br /><br />

<a name="Pillars"></a>

### Pillars of the framework:

The five pillars are listed here <a href="#Ordering">discussed below</a>.

<em>Click each pillar name link to go to contents about that pillar. (Note that "you" and "your" have been removed from text by AWS):</em>

   1. <a href="#Ops">OPS = <strong>Operational Excellence</strong></a> = The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and continually improve supporting processes and procedures 

   2. <a href="#Sec">SEC = <strong>Security</strong></a> = The ability to protect information, systems, and assets (applications and data) from threats. Google adds <strong>privacy, and compliance</strong>.

   3. <a href="#Reliability">REL = <strong>Reliability</strong></a> = The ability to recover from failures and continue to function. Also called "High Availability" by Azure.

   4. <a href="#Perf">PERF = <strong>Performance Efficiency</strong></a> = The ability to adapt to changes in load (scale)

   5. <a href="#Cost">COST = <strong>Cost Optimization</strong></a> = The ability to achieve business outcomes at the lowest price point - Managing costs to maximize the value delivered

PROTIP: "<strong>CROPS</strong>" is a mnemonic to make the 5 easier to remember.

Those core 5 is the rare occasion when it's what major cloud vendors all agree on.

Additional pillars added by individual vendors:

<ul>
   6. <a href="#SustLabs">SUST = <strong>Sustainability</strong></a> (only by AWS) for "Minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads. It includes a shared responsibility model for sustainability, understanding impact, and maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts". Examples are stopping over-provisioning, using more efficient Gravaton (non-x86) CPUs, etc.
<br /><br />
   6. Google adds its own <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/system-design">"System Design" pillar</a>.
</ul>

<a name="Ordering"></a>

### ACTIVITY 1 - Rank the pillars

Have each member of your team do a mental exercise to <strong>prioritize the pillars</strong> as the basis for a discussion, as a team. (Why? The Dunning-Kruger effect). Example realization from this exercise:

   * PROTIP: "Operational Excellence" has to go first because that's provides the fundamentals of getting up and running with basic services.

   * "Security" has to go first because we don't want to have the risk of anything exposed and thus ruin our brand.

   * Let's not slow ourselves down with Cost considerations when getting started.

   * PROTIP: It's really not appropriate to rank these pillars. They need to be done pretty much in parallel. So we need to look in each and prioritize the impact of tasks within each pillar.

QUESTION: Is it appropriate to assign a leader/team to be responsible for each separate pillar?


## Your Radar Chart of Progress:

PROTIP: To visualize (provide a mental picture of) progress toward using public cloud effectively, I created this sample Radar Chart within an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/wilsonmar.github.io/blob/master/docs/well-architected-radar.xlsx?raw=true">Excel file I built</a>:

<a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/139370139-f6ec275e-5882-4c80-80a7-5c309b48177b.png">
<img width="1762" alt="well-architected-radar-1762x662" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/139370139-f6ec275e-5882-4c80-80a7-5c309b48177b.png"></a>

The position of each pillar can be changed.

The percentage for each <a href="#Pillars">"pillar" category</a> is based on what has been <strong>achieved Now:</strong> (the inner blue line) and the <strong>Next: target</strong> (the outer red line).

The gaps (delta) between "Now" and "Next" are addressed by a <strong>backlog of activities</strong> designed to reach higher organizational and systems capability at building and operating systems using shared public clouds.

Percentages in the Radar Chart are based on a <strong>consistent and comprehensive</strong> set of <strong>design principles</strong> and <strong>best practices</strong> defined in the "Well-Architected" (WA) Framework.

The Well Architected Framework is really an <strong>industry standard</strong> because it is referenced by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google:

<a name="CommonDefinitions"></a>

## Common definitions:

Make sure everyone has a common understanding of each word:

   Each "<strong>workload</strong>" is "a collection of interrelated applications, infrastructure, policy, governance, and operations running on AWS that provides business or operational value". A workload can span several AWS accounts.

   A "<strong>technology portfolio</strong>" is the collection of workloads that are required for the business to operate.

   A "<strong>component</strong>" is the code, configuration, and  resources that together deliver against a requirement. A component is often the unit of technical ownership, and is decoupled from other components.

   The "<strong>architecture</strong>" is how components work together in a workload, usually illustrated by  architecture diagrams that show how components communicate and interact.

   The "<strong>organization</strong>" refers to the people in the hierarchy of reporting relationships. 
   The "<strong>AWS Organization</strong>" refers to the top- Organization setting, with special permissions to an administrator of it.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.runbook.en.html"><strong>Runbooks</strong></a> are predefined procedures containing the minimum information necessary to successfully perform the procedure.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.playbook.en.html"><strong>Playbooks</strong></a> document the investigation process - the predefined steps to gathering applicable information, identifying potential sources of failure, isolating faults, or determining the root cause of issues.

<a name="AssessmentTools"></a>

## WA Assessment Tools

Both Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS have an assessment tool based on WAF.

Amazon's Tool is operated by specialists who run an analysis of resources defined for each account.

Microsoft's tool is also based on what has been configured in its Azure cloud.
But its results are displayed automatically on every login unless it's turned off.

## AWS Cloud Adoption Framework

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-aws-cloud-adoption-framework/welcome.html" title="November 22, 2021">AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)</a> discusses these (yet another set of) perspectives:

   * Business
   * People
   * Governance
   * Platform
   * Security
   * Operations
   <br /><br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/149641454-9ff03c13-02d9-4964-88a4-0190e9811be4.png"><img alt="aws-cloud-adoption-11-2500x1470" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/149641454-9ff03c13-02d9-4964-88a4-0190e9811be4.png"></a>

### General Design Principles

AWS published these <a target="_blank" href="https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.design_principles.wa-dp.en.html">General Design Principles</a>:

   * <strong>Stop guessing capacity needs</strong> - if you make a poor capacity decision when deploying a workload, the team might end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with the performance implications of limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems can go away. Use as much or as little capacity as needed, and scale up and down automatically.

   * <strong>Test systems at production scale</strong> - In the cloud, a production-scale test environment can be created on demand, complete testing, and then decommission the resources. Because payment is only for the test environment when it's running, you can simulate live environments for a fraction of the cost of testing on premises.

   * <strong>Automate to make architectural experimentation easier</strong> (everything in AWS is an API) - Automation allows you to create and replicate workloads at low cost and avoid the expense of manual effort. You can track changes to the automation, audit the impact, and revert to previous parameters when necessary.

   * <strong>Allow for evolutionary architectures</strong> -  In a traditional environment, architectural decisions are often implemented as static, onetime events, with a few major versions of a system during its lifetime. As a business and its context continue to evolve, these initial decisions might hinder the system's ability to deliver changing business requirements. In the cloud, the capability to automate and test on demand lowers the risk of impact from design changes. This allows systems to evolve over time so that businesses can take advantage of innovations as a standard practice.

   * <strong>Drive architectures using data</strong> - In the cloud, you can collect data on how architectural choices affect the behavior of  workloads. This enable fact-based decisions on how to improve  workloads. Cloud infrastructure is code, so that data can be used to inform architecture choices and improvements over time.

   * <strong>Improve through "game days"</strong> (dry-run simulation, chaos engineering, etc.) - Test how architecture and processes perform by regularly scheduling game days to simulate events in production. This will help you understand where improvements can be made and can help develop organizational experience in dealing with events.

But what are specific actions?

   * have too many instructions for <strong>clicking and typing in GUI forms</strong> instead of automated actions performed by scripts (such as <a target="_blank" href="https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/200_labs/200_automated_deployment_of_vpc/1_create_vpc_stack/">these steps to create VPCs in 3 AZs</a>) instead of shell scripts
   * reference AWS' <strong>CloudFormation templates</strong> (such as <a target="_blank" href="https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/Common/Create_VPC_Stack/Code/vpc-alb-app-db.yaml">this 2138-line vpc-alb-app-db.yaml file</a>) as Infrastructure-as-Code (for better repeatability, collaboration versioning, security, etc.) instead of HashiCorp Terraform files
   <br /><br />
   
Thus, items below have <strong>[Terraform]</strong> links to Terraform HCL (plus Bash shell scripts and Ansible, where applicable).

Each link will go to a web page containing a Twitch-type Zoom recording walking through the steps, then showing the equivalent Terraform.

PROTIP: We analyze utilities <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer">Google's terraformer</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.cycloid.io/what-is-terracognita">cloud diagram creator Cycloid's</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cycloidio/terracognita">terracognita</a> which create Terraform files based on what has been created in AWS ("reverse Terraform").
Wisdom Hambolu analyzes use of a utility that attempts to convert Cloud Formation to Terraform, with mixed results.

* Data protection: sovereignty and encryption
* Incidence response
* Application security
* Security resources
<br /><br />

Key Design principles for security in the cloud:

* Implement a strong identity foundation
* Enable traceability
* Apply security at all layers (levels)

* Automate security best practices
* Protect data in transit and at rest
* Keep people away from data
* Prepare for security events (incident response)

* Identify and validate control objectives
* Automate testing and validation of security controls in pipelines

Questions and Considerations for Security:

<a name="SecureWorkload"></a>

### 1. How do you securely operate each workload?

   1. <a name="SEC-01-01-GrowSepAccts"><tt>SEC-01-01-GrowSepAccts</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Separate workloads using accounts</strong> - Organize workloads in separate accounts and group accounts based on function or a common set of controls rather than mirroring the company’s reporting structure. Start with security and infrastructure in mind to enable the organization to set common <strong>guardrails</strong> as workloads grow. 

   2. <a name="SEC-01-02-SecAccts"><tt>SEC-01-02-SecAccts</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Secure AWS account Secure access to accounts</strong> - for example by enabling MFA and restrict use of the root user, and configure account contacts. 

   3. <a name="SEC-01-03-ControlObjs"><tt>SEC-01-03-ControlObjs</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Identify and validate control objectives</strong> - Based on compliance requirements and risks identified from the threat model, derive and validate the control objectives and controls that you need to apply to workloads. Ongoing validation of control objectives and controls help you measure the effectiveness of risk mitigation. 
   <br />

   4. <a name="SEC-01-04-NoticeThreats"><tt>SEC-01-04-NoticeThreats</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Keep up to date with security threats</strong> - Recognize attack vectors by staying up to date with the latest security threats to help you define and implement appropriate controls.

   5. <a name="SEC-01-05-NoticeRecommendations"><tt>SEC-01-05-NoticeRecommendations</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Keep up to date with security recommendations</strong> - Stay up to date with both AWS and industry security recommendations to evolve the security posture of workloads.
   
   6. <a name="SEC-01-06-AutoTesting"><tt>SEC-01-06-AutoTesting</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Automate testing and validation of security controls in pipelines</strong> - Establish secure baselines and templates for security mechanisms that are tested and validated as part of builds, pipelines, and processes. Use tools and automation to test and validate all security controls continuously. For example, scan items such as machine images and infrastructure as code templates for security vulnerabilities, irregularities, and drift from an established baseline at each stage.
   
   7. <a name="SEC-01-07-ThreatModel"><tt>SEC-01-07-ThreatModel</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Identify and prioritize risks using a threat model</strong> - Use a threat model to identify and maintain an up-to-date register of potential threats. <strong>Prioritize threats and adapt</strong> security controls to prevent, detect, and respond. Revisit and maintain this in the context of the evolving security landscape.
   
   8. <a name="SEC-01-08-EvalNewSvcs"><tt>SEC-01-08-EvalNewSvcs</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Evaluate and implement new security services and features regularly</strong> - AWS and APN Partners constantly release new features and services that allow you to evolve the security posture of workloads.
   

   <a name="ManageIdentities"></a>

### 2. How do you manage identities for people and machines?

   1. <a name="SEC-02-01-SignInMFA"><tt>SEC-02-01-SignInMFA</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use strong sign-in mechanisms</strong> - Enforce minimum password length, and educate users to avoid common or re-used passwords. Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) with software or hardware mechanisms to provide an additional layer. Use temporary credentials
   
   2. <a name="SEC-02-02-SSO-IAM"><tt>SEC-02-02-SSO-IAM</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Require identities to dynamically acquire temporary credentials.</strong> - For workforce identities, use AWS Single Sign-On, or federation with IAM roles to access AWS accounts. For machine identities, require the use of IAM roles instead of long term access keys.
   
   3. <a name="SEC-02-03-AutoRotationSvc"><tt>SEC-02-03-AutoRotationSvc</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Store and use secrets securely</strong> - For workforce and machine identities that require secrets such as passwords to third party applications, store them with automatic rotation using the latest industry standards in a specialized service.
   
   4. <a name="SEC-02-04-CentralIdP"><tt>SEC-02-04-CentralIdP</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Rely on a centralized identity provider</strong> - For workforce identities, rely on an identity provider that enables you to manage identities in a centralized place. This enables you to create, manage, and revoke access from a single location -- making it easier to manage access. This reduces the requirement for multiple credentials and provides an opportunity to integrate with HR processes.
   

   5. <a name="SEC-02-05-LongCredRotation"><tt>SEC-02-05-LongCredRotation</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Audit and rotate credentials periodically</strong> - When you cannot rely on temporary credentials and require long term credentials, audit credentials to ensure that the defined controls (for example, MFA) are enforced, rotated regularly, and have appropriate access level.
   
   6. <a name="SEC-02-06-UserAttributes"><tt>SEC-02-06-UserAttributes</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Leverage user groups and attributes</strong> - Place users with common security requirements in groups defined by identity providers, and put mechanisms in place to ensure that user attributes that may be used for access control (e.g., department or location) are correct and updated. Use these groups and attributes, rather than individual users, to control access. This manages access centrally by changing a user’s group membership or attributes once, rather than updating many individual policies when a user’s access needs change.
   

   <a name="ManagePermissions"></a>

### 3. How do you manage permissions for people and machines?

   1. <a name="SEC-03-01-DefAccess"><tt>SEC-03-01-DefAccess</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Define access requirements</strong> - Each component or resource of a workload needs to be accessed by administrators, end users, or other components. Have a clear definition of who or what should have access to each component, choose the appropriate identity type and method of authentication and authorization.

   2. <a name="SEC-03-02-LeastPrivilege"><tt>SEC-03-02-LeastPrivilege</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Grant least privilege access</strong> - Grant only the access that identities require by allowing access to specific actions on specific AWS resources under specific conditions. Rely on groups and identity attributes to dynamically set permissions at scale, rather than defining permissions for individual users. For example, you can allow a group of developers access to manage only resources for their project. This way, when a developer is removed from the group, access for the developer is revoked everywhere that group was used for access control, without requiring any changes to the access policies.
   
   3. <a name="SEC-03-03-EmergAccess"><tt>SEC-03-03-EmergAccess</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Establish emergency access process</strong> - A process that allows emergency access to workloads in the unlikely event of an automated process or pipeline issue. This will help you rely on least privilege access, but ensure users can obtain the right of access when they require it. For example, establish a process for administrators to verify and approve their request.

   4. <a name="SEC-03-04-ReducePerms"><tt>SEC-03-04-ReducePerms</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Reduce permissions continuously</strong> - As teams and workloads determine what access they need, remove permissions they no longer use and establish review processes to achieve least privilege permissions. Continuously monitor and reduce unused identities and permissions.

   5. <a name="SEC-03-05-PermisGuards"><tt>SEC-03-05-PermisGuards</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Define permission guardrails for the organization</strong> - Establish common controls that restrict access to all identities in the organization. For example, you can restrict access to specific AWS Regions, or prevent operators from deleting common resources, such as an IAM role used for the central security team.
   
   6. <a name="SEC-03-06-FederatedLifecycle"><tt>SEC-03-06-FederatedLifecycle</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Manage access based on life cycle</strong> - Integrate access controls with operator and application life cycle and centralized federation providers. For example, remove a user’s access when they leave the organization or change roles.
   

   7. <a name="SEC-03-07-CrossAcctAccess"><tt>SEC-03-07-CrossAcctAccess</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Analyze public and cross-account access</strong> - Continuously monitor findings that highlight public and cross account access. Reduce public access and cross account access to only resources that require this type of access.
   
   8. <a name="SEC-03-08-SharedAccess"><tt>SEC-03-08-SharedAccess</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Share resources securely</strong> - Govern the consumption of shared resources across accounts or within the AWS Organization. Monitor shared resources and review shared resource access.
   

   <a name="DetectEvents"></a>

### 4. How do you detect and investigate security events?

   1. <a name="SEC-04-01-"><tt>SEC-04-01-</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Configure service and application logging</strong> - Configure logging throughout the workload, including application logs, resource logs, and AWS service logs. For example, ensure that AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub are enabled for all accounts within the organization.
   
   2. <a name="SEC-04-02-"><tt>SEC-04-02-</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Analyze logs, findings, and metrics centrally</strong> - All logs, metrics, and telemetry should be collected centrally, and automatically analyzed to detect anomalies and indicators of unauthorized activity. A dashboard can provide you easy to access insight into real-time health. For example, ensure that Amazon GuardDuty and Security Hub logs are sent to a central location for alerting and analysis.

   3. <a name="SEC-04-03-"><tt>SEC-04-03-</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Automate response to events</strong> - Using automation to investigate and remediate events reduces human effort and error, and enables you to scale investigation capabilities. Regular reviews will help you tune automation tools, and continuously iterate. For example, automate responses to Amazon GuardDuty events by automating the first investigation step, then iterate to gradually remove human effort.

   4. <a name="SEC-04-04-"><tt>SEC-04-04-</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Implement actionable security events</strong> - Create alerts that are sent to and can be actioned by the team. Ensure that alerts include relevant information for the team to take action. For example, ensure that Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub alerts are sent to the team to action, or sent to response automation tooling with the team remaining informed by messaging from the automation framework.
   

   <a name="ProtectNetwork"></a>

### 5. How do you protect network resources?

   1. <a name="SEC-05-01-"><tt>SEC-05-08-NetLayers</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Create network layers</strong> - Group (separate) components that share reachability requirements into layers. For example, a database cluster in a VPC with no need for internet access should be placed in subnets with no route to or from the internet. In a serverless workload operating without a VPC, similar layering and segmentation with microservices can achieve the same goal.
   
   2. <a name="SEC-05-02-"><tt>SEC-05-08-ControlTraffic</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Control traffic at all layers</strong> - Apply controls with a defense in depth approach for both inbound and outbound traffic. For example, for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) this includes security groups, Network ACLs, and subnets. For AWS Lambda, consider running in private VPC with VPC-based controls.
   
   3. <a name="SEC-05-03-"><tt>SEC-05-08-ProtectNetwork</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Automate network protection</strong> - Automate protection mechanisms to provide a self-defending network based on threat intelligence and anomaly detection. For example, intrusion detection and prevention tools that can pro-actively adapt to current threats and reduce their impact.

   4. <a name="SEC-05-04-"><tt>SEC-05-08-InspectNet</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement inspection and protection</strong> - Inspect and filter traffic at each layer. For example, use a web application firewall to help protect against inadvertent access at the application network layer. For Lambda functions, third-party tools can add application-layer firewalling to the runtime environment.
   

   <a name="ProtectCompute"></a>

### 6. How do you protect compute resources?

   1. <a name="SEC-06-01-"><tt>SEC-06-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Perform vulnerability management</strong> - Frequently scan and patch for vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, and  infrastructure to help protect against new threats.
   
   2. <a name="SEC-06-02-"><tt>SEC-06-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Reduce attack surface</strong> - Reduce attack surfaces by hardening operating systems, minimizing components, libraries, and externally consumable services in use.
   
   3. <a name="SEC-06-03-"><tt>SEC-06-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement managed services</strong> - Implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS, to reduce security maintenance tasks as part of the shared responsibility model.

   4. <a name="SEC-06-04-"><tt>SEC-06-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Automate compute protection</strong> - Automate protective compute mechanisms, including vulnerability management, for reduction in attack surface, and management of resources.

   5. <a name="SEC-06-05-"><tt>SEC-06-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Enable people to perform actions at a distance</strong> - Removing the ability for interactive access reduces the risk of human error, and the potential for manual configuration or management. For example, use a change management workflow to deploy EC2 instances using infrastructure as code, then manage EC2 instances using tools instead of allowing direct access or a bastion host.
   
   6. <a name="SEC-06-06-"><tt>SEC-06-06-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Validate software integrity</strong> - Implement mechanisms (for example, code signing) to validate that the software, code, and libraries used in the workload are from trusted sources and have not been tampered with.
   

   <a name="ClassifyData"></a>

### 7. How do you classify data?

   1. <a name="SEC-07-01-"><tt>SEC-07-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Identify the data within workloads</strong> - This includes the type and classification of data, the associated business processes. data owner, applicable legal and compliance requirements, where it’s stored, and the resulting controls that are needed to be enforced. This may include classifications to indicate if the data is intended to be publicly available, if the data is internal use only such as customer personally identifiable information (PII), or if the data is for more restricted access such as intellectual property, legally privileged or marked sensitive, and more.

   2. <a name="SEC-07-02-"><tt>SEC-07-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Define data protection controls</strong> - Protect data according to its classification level. For example, secure data classified as public by using relevant recommendations while protecting sensitive data with additional controls. Automate identification and classification</strong> of data to reduce the risk of human error from manual interactions.
   <tt>SEC-07-02-</tt>

   3. <a name="SEC-07-03-"><tt>SEC-07-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Define data lifecycle management</strong> - The defined lifecycle strategy should be based on sensitivity level, as well as legal and organization requirements. Aspects including the duration you retain data for, data destruction, data access management, data transformation, and data sharing should be considered.
   

   <a name="ProtectDataAtRest"></a>

### 8. How do you protect data at rest?

   1. <a name="SEC-08-01-"><tt>SEC-08-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement secure key management</strong> - Encryption keys must be stored securely, with strict access control, for example, by using a key management service such as AWS KMS. Consider using different keys, and access control to the keys, combined with the AWS IAM and resource policies, to align with data classification levels and segregation requirements.

   2. <a name="SEC-08-02-"><tt>SEC-08-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Enforce encryption at rest</strong> - Enforce encryption requirements based on the latest standards and recommendations to help protect data at rest.

   3. <a name="SEC-08-03-"><tt>SEC-08-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Automate data at rest protection</strong> - Use automated tools to validate and enforce data at rest protection continuously, for example, verify that there are only encrypted storage resources.
   
   4. <a name="SEC-08-04-"><tt>SEC-08-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Enforce access control</strong> - Enforce access control with least privileges and mechanisms, including backups, isolation, and versioning, to help protect data at rest. Prevent operators from granting public access to data.
   
   5. <a name="SEC-08-05-"><tt>SEC-08-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use mechanisms to keep people away from data</strong> - Keep all users away from directly accessing sensitive data and systems under normal operational circumstances. For example, provide a dashboard instead of direct access to a data store to run queries. Where CI/CD pipelines are not used, determine which controls and processes are required to adequately provide a normally disabled break-glass access mechanism.
   

   <a name="ProtectDataInTransit"></a>

### 9. How do you protect data in transit?

   1. <a name="SEC-09-01-TransitKeys"><tt>SEC-09-01-TransitKeys</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement secure key and certificate management</strong> - Store encryption keys and certificates securely and rotate them at appropriate time intervals while applying strict access control; for example, by using a certificate management service, such as AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

   2. <a name="SEC-09-02-EnforceTransit"><tt>SEC-09-02-EnforceTransit</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Enforce encryption in transit</strong> - Enforce defined encryption requirements based on appropriate standards and recommendations to help you meet organizational, legal, and compliance requirements.
   
   3. <a name="SEC-09-03-DetectAccesst"><tt>SEC-09-03-DetectAccess</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Automate detection of unintended data access</strong> - Use tools such as GuardDuty to automatically detect attempts to move data outside of defined boundaries based on data classification level, for example, to detect a trojan that is copying data to an unknown or untrusted network using the DNS protocol.
   
   4. <a name="SEC-09-04-AuthNetComm"><tt>SEC-09-04-AuthNetComm</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Authenticate network communications</strong> - Verify the identity of communications by using protocols that support authentication, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or IPsec.
   


   <a name="IncidentRecovery"></a>

### 10. How do you anticipate, respond to, and recover from incidents?

   1. <a name="SEC-10-01-"><tt>SEC-10-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Identify key personnel and external resources</strong> - Identify internal and external personnel, resources, and legal obligations that would help the organization respond to an incident.

   2. <a name="SEC-10-02-"><tt>SEC-10-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Develop incident management plans</strong> - Create "playbooks" to help  respond to, communicate during, and recover from an incident. For example, start an <u>incident response plan</u> with the most likely scenarios for workloads and organizations. Include how you would communicate and escalate both internally and externally.

   3. <a name="SEC-10-03-"><tt>SEC-10-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Prepare forensic capabilities</strong> - Identify and prepare forensic investigation capabilities that are suitable, including external specialists, tools, and automation.

   4. <a name="SEC-10-04-"><tt>SEC-10-04-</tt></a><br /><br />

Questions and considerations for Reliability:

<a name="ManageServiceQuotes"></a>

### 1. How do you manage service quotas and constraints?

   1. <a name="REL-01-01-"><tt>REL-01-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Aware of service quotas and constraints</strong> - You are aware of default quotas and quota increase requests for workload architecture. You additionally know which resource constraints, such as disk or network, are potentially impactful.

   2. <a name="REL-01-02-"><tt>REL-01-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Manage service quotas across accounts and regions</strong> - If you are using multiple AWS accounts or AWS Regions, ensure that you request the appropriate quotas in all environments in which  production workloads run.

   3. <a name="REL-01-03-"><tt>REL-01-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Accommodate fixed service quotas and constraints through architecture</strong> - Be aware of unchangeable service quotas and physical resources, and architect to prevent these from impacting reliability.
   
   4. <a name="REL-01-04-"><tt>REL-01-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Monitor and manage quotas</strong> - Evaluate potential usage and increase quotas appropriately allowing for planned growth in usage.

   5. <a name="REL-01-05-"><tt>REL-01-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Automate quota management</strong> - Implement tools to alert you when thresholds are being approached. By using AWS Service Quotas APIs, you can automate quota increase requests.

   6. <a name="REL-01-06-"><tt>REL-01-06-</tt></a><br /><br />   
   <strong>Ensure that a sufficient gap exists between the current quotas and the maximum usage to accommodate failover</strong> - When a resource fails, it may still be counted against quotas until its successfully terminated. Ensure that quotas cover the overlap of all failed resources with replacements before the failed resources are terminated. You should consider an Availability Zone failure when calculating this gap.
   

   <a name="PlanNetwork"></a>

### 2. How do you plan network topology?

   1. <a name="REL-02-01-"><tt>REL-02-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use highly available network connectivity for workload public endpoints</strong> - These endpoints and the routing to them must be highly available. To achieve this, use highly available DNS, content delivery networks (CDNs), API Gateway, load balancing, or reverse proxies.

   2. <a name="REL-02-02-"><tt>REL-02-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Provision redundant connectivity between private networks in the cloud and on-premises environments</strong> - Use multiple AWS Direct Connect (DX) connections or VPN tunnels between separately deployed private networks. Use multiple DX locations for high availability. If using multiple AWS Regions, ensure redundancy in at least two of them. You might want to evaluate AWS Marketplace appliances that terminate VPNs. If you use AWS Marketplace appliances, deploy redundant instances for high availability in different Availability Zones.

   3. <a name="REL-02-03-"><tt>REL-02-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Ensure IP subnet allocation accounts for expansion and availability</strong> - Amazon VPC IP address ranges must be large enough to accommodate workload requirements, including factoring in future expansion and allocation of IP addresses to subnets across Availability Zones. This includes load balancers, EC2 instances, and container-based applications.

   4. <a name="REL-02-04-"><tt>REL-02-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Prefer hub-and-spoke topologies over many-to-many mesh</strong> - If more than two network address spaces (for example, VPCs and on-premises networks) are connected via VPC peering, AWS Direct Connect, or VPN, then use a hub-and-spoke model, like that provided by AWS Transit Gateway.

   5. <a name="REL-02-05-"><tt>REL-02-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Enforce non-overlapping private IP address ranges in all private address spaces where they are connected</strong> - The IP address ranges of each of VPCs must not overlap when peered or connected via VPN. You must similarly avoid IP address conflicts between a VPC and on-premises environments or with other cloud providers that you use. You must also have a way to allocate private IP address ranges when needed.


   <a name="DesignWorkload"></a>

### 3. How do you design workload service architecture?

   1. <a name="REL-03-01-"><tt>REL-03-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Choose how to segment workloads</strong> - Monolithic architecture should be avoided. Instead, you should choose between SOA and microservices. When making each choice, balance the benefits against the complexities—what is right for a new product racing to first launch is different than what a workload built to scale from the start needs. The benefits of using smaller segments include greater agility, organizational flexibility, and scalability. Complexities include possible increased latency, more complex debugging, and increased operational burden.
   
   2. <a name="REL-03-02-"><tt>REL-03-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Build services focused on specific business domains and functionality</strong> - SOA builds services with well-delineated functions defined by business needs. Microservices use domain models and bounded context to limit this further so that each service does just one thing. Focusing on specific functionality enables you to differentiate the reliability requirements of different services, and target investments more specifically. A concise business problem and having a small team associated with each service also enables easier organizational scaling.

   3. <a name="REL-03-03-"><tt>REL-03-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Provide service contracts per API</strong> - Service contracts are documented agreements between teams on service integration and include a machine-readable API definition, rate limits, and performance expectations. A versioning strategy allows clients to continue using the existing API and migrate their applications to the newer API when they are ready. Deployment can happen anytime, as long as the contract is not violated. The service provider team can use the technology stack of their choice to satisfy the API contract. Similarly, the service consumer can use their own technology.
   

   <a name="PreventFailures"></a>

### 4. How do you design interactions in a distributed system to prevent failures?

   1. <a name="REL-04-01-"><tt>REL-04-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Identify which kind of distributed system is required</strong> - Hard real-time distributed systems require responses to be given synchronously and rapidly, while soft real-time systems have a more generous time window of minutes or more for response. Offline systems handle responses through batch or asynchronous processing. Hard real-time distributed systems have the most stringent reliability requirements.

   2. <a name="REL-04-02-"><tt>REL-04-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement loosely coupled dependencies</strong> - Dependencies such as queuing systems, streaming systems, workflows, and load balancers are loosely coupled. Loose coupling helps isolate behavior of a component from other components that depend on it, increasing resiliency and agility
   
   3. <a name="REL-04-03-"><tt>REL-04-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Make all responses idempotent</strong> - An idempotent service promises that each request is completed exactly once, such that making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request. An idempotent service makes it easier for a client to implement retries without fear that a request will be erroneously processed multiple times. To do this, clients can issue API requests with an idempotency token—the same token is used whenever the request is repeated. An idempotent service API uses the token to return a response identical to the response that was returned the first time that the request was completed.
   
   4. <a name="REL-04-04-"><tt>REL-04-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Do constant work</strong> - Systems can fail when there are large, rapid changes in load. For example, a health check system that monitors the health of thousands of servers should send the same size payload (a full snapshot of the current state) each time. Whether no servers are failing, or all of them, the health check system is doing constant work with no large, rapid changes.
   

   <a name="WithstandFailure"></a>

### 5. How do you design interactions in a distributed system to mitigate or withstand failures?

   1. <a name="REL-05-01-"><tt>REL-05-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement graceful degradation to transform applicable hard dependencies into soft dependencies</strong> - When a component's dependencies are unhealthy, the component itself can still function, although in a degraded manner. For example, when a dependency call fails, failover to a predetermined static response.
   
   2. <a name="REL-05-02-"><tt>REL-05-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Throttle requests</strong> - This is a mitigation pattern to respond to an unexpected increase in demand. Some requests are honored but those over a defined limit are rejected and return a message indicating they have been throttled. The expectation on clients is that they will back off and abandon the request or try again at a slower rate.
   
   3. <a name="REL-05-03-"><tt>REL-05-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Control and limit retry calls</strong> - Use exponential backoff to retry after progressively longer intervals. Introduce jitter to randomize those retry intervals, and limit the maximum number of retries.

   4. <a name="REL-05-04-"><tt>REL-05-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Fail fast and limit queues</strong> - If the workload is unable to respond successfully to a request, then fail fast. This allows the releasing of resources associated with a request, and permits the service to recover if it’s running out of resources. If the workload is able to respond successfully but the rate of requests is too high, then use a queue to buffer requests instead. However, do not allow long queues that can result in serving stale requests that the client has already given up on.
   
   5. <a name="REL-05-05-"><tt>REL-05-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Set client timeouts</strong> - Set timeouts appropriately, verify them systematically, and do not rely on default values as they are generally set too high

   6. <a name="REL-05-06-"><tt>REL-05-06-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Make services stateless where possible</strong> - Services should either not require state, or should offload state such that between different client requests, there is no dependence on locally stored data on disk or in memory. This enables servers to be replaced at will without causing an availability impact. Amazon ElastiCache or Amazon DynamoDB are good destinations for offloaded state.
   
   7. <a name="REL-05-07-"><tt>REL-05-07-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement emergency levers</strong> - These are rapid processes that may mitigate availability impact on workloads. They can be operated in the absence of a root cause. An ideal emergency lever reduces the cognitive burden on the resolvers to zero by providing fully deterministic activation and deactivation criteria. Example levers include blocking all robot traffic or serving a static response. Levers are often manual, but they can also be automated.

   <strong>Conduct reviews regularly</strong> - Frequently review how workload monitoring is implemented and update it based on significant events and changes

   7. <a name="REL-06-06-"><tt>REL-06-07-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Monitor end-to-end tracing of requests through the system</strong> - Use AWS X-Ray or third-party tools so that developers can more easily analyze and debug distributed systems to understand how their applications and its underlying services are performing
   

   <a name="AdaptToDemand"></a>

### 7. How do you design workloads to adapt to changes in demand?

   1. <a name="REL-07-01-"><tt>REL-07-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use automation when obtaining or scaling resources</strong> - When replacing impaired resources or scaling workloads, automate the process by using managed AWS services, such as Amazon S3 and AWS Auto Scaling. You can also use third-party tools and AWS SDKs to automate scaling.

   2. <a name="REL-07-02-"><tt>REL-07-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Obtain resources upon detection of impairment to a workload</strong> - Scale resources reactively when necessary if availability is impacted, to restore workload availability.
   
   3. <a name="REL-07-03-"><tt>REL-07-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Obtain resources upon detection that more resources are needed for a workload</strong> - Scale resources proactively to meet demand and avoid availability impact.
   
   4. <a name="REL-07-04-"><tt>REL-07-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Load test workloads</strong> - Adopt a load testing methodology to measure if scaling activity meets workload requirements.
   

   <a name="ImplementChange"></a>

### 8. How do you implement change?

   1. <a name="REL-08-01-"><tt>REL-08-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use runbooks for standard activities such as deployment</strong> - Runbooks are the predefined steps used to achieve specific outcomes. Use runbooks to perform standard activities, whether done manually or automatically. Examples include deploying a workload, patching it, or making DNS modifications.
   
   2. <a name="REL-08-02-"><tt>REL-08-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Integrate functional testing as part of deployments</strong> - Functional tests are run as part of automated deployment. If success criteria are not met, the pipeline is halted or rolled back.
   
   3. <a name="REL-08-03-"><tt>REL-08-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Integrate resiliency testing as part of deployments</strong> - Resiliency tests (as part of chaos engineering) are run as part of the automated deployment pipeline in a pre-prod environment.

   4. <a name="REL-08-04-"><tt>REL-08-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Deploy using immutable infrastructure</strong> - This is a model that mandates that no updates, security patches, or configuration changes happen in-place on production workloads. When a change is needed, the architecture is built onto new infrastructure and deployed into production.

   5. <a name="REL-08-05-"><tt>REL-08-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Deploy changes with automation</strong> - Automate Deployments and patching to eliminate negative impact.
   

   <a name="BackUpData"></a>

### 9. How do you back up data?

   1. <a name="REL-09-01-"><tt>REL-09-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Identify and back up all data that needs to be backed up, or reproduce the data from sources</strong> - Amazon S3 can be used as a backup destination for multiple data sources. AWS services such as Amazon EBS, Amazon RDS, and Amazon DynamoDB have built in capabilities to create backups. Third-party backup software can also be used. Alternatively, if the data can be reproduced from other sources to meet RPO, you might not require a backup

   2. <a name="REL-09-02-"><tt>REL-09-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Secure and encrypt backups</strong> - Detect access using authentication and authorization, such as AWS IAM, and detect data integrity compromise by using encryption.

   3. <a name="REL-09-03-"><tt>REL-09-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Perform data backup automatically</strong> - Configure backups to be taken automatically based on a periodic schedule, or by changes in the dataset. RDS instances, EBS volumes, DynamoDB tables, and S3 objects can all be configured for automatic backup. AWS Marketplace solutions or third-party solutions can also be used.

   4. <a name="REL-09-04-"><tt>REL-09-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Perform periodic recovery of the data to verify backup integrity and processes</strong> - Validate that backup process implementation meets recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) by performing a recovery test.
   

   <a name="FaultIsolation"></a>

### 10. How do you use fault isolation to protect workloads?

   1. <a name="REL-10-01-"><tt>REL-10-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Deploy the workload to multiple locations</strong> - Distribute workload data and resources across multiple Availability Zones or, where necessary, across AWS Regions. These locations can be as diverse as required.

   2. <a name="REL-10-02-"><tt>REL-10-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Automate recovery for components constrained to a single location</strong> - If components of the workload can only run in a single Availability Zone or on-premises data center, you must implement the capability to do a complete rebuild of the workload within defined recovery objectives.
   <tt>REL-10-02-</tt>

   3. <a name="REL-10-03-"><tt>REL-10-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use bulkhead architectures</strong> - Like the bulkheads on a ship, this pattern ensures that a failure is contained to a small subset of requests/users so the number of impaired requests is limited, and most can continue without error. Bulkheads for data are usually called partitions or shards, while bulkheads for services are known as cells.
   

   <a name="WithstandComponentFailure"></a>

### 11. How do you design workloads to withstand component failures?

   1. <a name="REL-11-01-"><tt>REL-11-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Monitor all components of the workload to detect failures</strong> - Continuously monitor the health of workloads so that people and automated systems are aware of degradation or complete failure as soon as they occur. Monitor for key performance indicators (KPIs) based on business value.

   2. <a name="REL-11-02-"><tt>REL-11-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Fail over to healthy resources</strong> - Ensure that if a resource failure occurs, that healthy resources can continue to serve requests. For location failures (such as Availability Zone or AWS Region) ensure you have systems in place to fail over to healthy resources in unimpaired locations.

   3. <a name="REL-11-03-"><tt>REL-11-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Automate healing on all layers</strong> - Upon detection of a failure, use automated capabilities to perform actions to remediate.

   4. <a name="REL-11-04-"><tt>REL-11-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use static stability to prevent bimodal behavior</strong> - Bimodal behavior is when a workload exhibits different behavior under normal and failure modes, for example, relying on launching new instances if an Availability Zone fails. You should instead build workloads that are statically stable and operate in only one mode. In this case, provision enough instances in each Availability Zone to handle the workload load if one AZ were removed and then use Elastic Load Balancing or Amazon Route 53 health checks to shift load away from the impaired instances.

   5. <a name="REL-11-05-"><tt>REL-11-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Send notifications when events impact availability</strong> - Notifications are sent upon the detection of significant events, even if the issue caused by the event was automatically resolved.


   <a name="TestReliability"></a>

### 12. How do you test reliability?

   1. <a name="REL-12-01-"><tt>REL-12-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use playbooks to investigate failures</strong> - Enable consistent and prompt responses to failure scenarios that are not well understood, by documenting the investigation process in playbooks. Playbooks are the predefined steps performed to identify the factors contributing to a failure scenario. The results from any process step are used to determine the next steps to take until the issue is identified or escalated.

   2. <a name="REL-12-02-"><tt>REL-12-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Perform post-incident analysis</strong> - Review customer-impacting events, and identify the contributing factors and preventative action items. Use this information to develop mitigations to limit or prevent recurrence. Develop procedures for prompt and effective responses. Communicate contributing factors and corrective actions as appropriate, tailored to target audiences. Have a method to communicate these causes to others as needed.

   3. <a name="REL-12-03-"><tt>REL-12-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Test functional requirements</strong> - These include unit tests and integration tests that validate required functionality.
   
   4. <a name="REL-12-04-"><tt>REL-12-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Test scaling and performance requirements</strong> - This includes load testing to validate that the workload meets scaling and performance requirements.

   5. <a name="REL-12-05-"><tt>REL-12-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Test resiliency using chaos engineering</strong> - Run tests that inject failures regularly into pre-production and production environments. Hypothesize how each workload will react to the failure, then compare hypothesis to the testing results and iterate if they do not match. Ensure that production testing does not impact users.

   6. <a name="REL-12-06-"><tt>REL-12-06-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Conduct game days regularly</strong> - Use game days to regularly exercise failure procedures as close to production as possible (including in production environments) with the people who will be involved in actual failure scenarios. Game days enforce measures to ensure that production testing does not impact users.
   

   <a name="PlanforDR"></a>

### 13. How do you plan for disaster recovery (DR)?

   1. <a name="REL-13-01-"><tt>REL-13-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Define recovery objectives for downtime and data loss</strong> - The workload has a recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).

   2. <a name="REL-13-02-"><tt>REL-13-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use defined recovery strategies to meet the recovery objectives</strong> - Define a disaster recovery (DR) strategy to meet objectives.

   3. <a name="REL-13-03-"><tt>REL-13-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Test disaster recovery implementation to validate the implementation</strong> - Regularly test failover to DR to ensure that RTO and RPO are met.

   4. <a name="REL-13-04-"><tt>REL-13-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Manage configuration drift at the DR site or region</strong> - Ensure that the infrastructure, data, and configuration are as needed at the DR site or region. For example, check that AMIs and service quotas are up to date.

   5. <a name="REL-13-05-"><tt>REL-13-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Automate recovery</strong> - Use AWS or third-party tools to automate system recovery and route traffic to the DR site or region.

Questions and Considerations for Operational Excellence:

<a name="DeterminePriorities"></a>

### 1. How do you determine what <strong>operational priorities</strong> are?

   1. <a name="OPS-01-01-"><tt>OPS-01-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Evaluate external customer needs</strong> - Involve key stakeholders, including business, development, and operations teams, to determine where to focus efforts on external customer needs. This will ensure that you have a thorough understanding of the operations support that is required to achieve desired business outcomes.

   2. <a name="OPS-01-02-"><tt>OPS-01-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Evaluate internal customer needs</strong> - Involve key stakeholders, including business, development, and operations teams, when determining where to focus efforts on internal customer needs. This will ensure that you have a thorough understanding of the operations support that is required to achieve business outcomes.

   3. <a name="OPS-01-03-"><tt>OPS-01-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Evaluate governance requirements</strong> - Ensure awareness of guidelines or obligations defined by organization that may mandate or emphasize specific focus. Evaluate internal factors, such as organization policy, standards, and requirements. Validate that you have mechanisms to identify changes to governance. If no governance requirements are identified, ensure that you have applied due diligence to this determination.

   4. <a name="OPS-01-04-"><tt>OPS-01-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Evaluate compliance requirements</strong> - Evaluate external factors, such as regulatory compliance requirements and industry standards, to ensure that you are aware of guidelines or obligations that may mandate or emphasize specific focus. If no compliance requirements are identified, ensure that you apply due diligence to this determination.

   5. <a name="OPS-01-05-"><tt>OPS-01-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Evaluate threat landscape</strong> - Evaluate threats to the business (for example, competition, business risk and liabilities, operational risks, and information security threats) and maintain current information in a risk registry. Include the impact of risks when determining where to focus efforts.
   
   6. <a name="OPS-01-06-"><tt>OPS-01-06-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Evaluate tradeoffs</strong> - Evaluate the impact of tradeoffs between competing interests or alternative approaches, to help make informed decisions when determining where to focus efforts or choosing a course of action. For example, accelerating speed to market for new features may be emphasized over cost optimization, or you may choose a relational database for non-relational data to simplify the effort to migrate a system, rather than migrating to a database optimized by data type and updating application.

   7. <a name="OPS-01-07-"><tt>OPS-01-07-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Manage benefits and risks</strong> - Manage benefits and risks to make informed decisions when determining where to focus efforts. For example, it may be beneficial to deploy a workload with unresolved issues so that significant new features can be made available to customers. It may be possible to mitigate associated risks, or it may become unacceptable to allow a risk to remain, in which case you will take action to address the risk.
   

   <a name="StructureBusinessOutcomes"></a>

### 2. How do you structure the organization to support business outcomes?

   aka the "Operating Model"

   1. <a name="OPS-02-01-"><tt>OPS-02-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Resources have identified owners</strong> - Understand who has ownership of each application, workload, platform, and infrastructure component, what business value is provided by that component, and why that ownership exists. Understanding the business value of these individual components and how they support business outcomes informs the processes and procedures applied against them.

   2. <a name="OPS-02-02-"><tt>OPS-02-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Processes and procedures have identified owners</strong> - Understand who has ownership of the definition of individual processes and procedures, why those specific process and procedures are used, and why that ownership exists. Understanding the reasons that specific processes and procedures are used enables identification of improvement opportunities.

   3. <a name="OPS-02-03-"><tt>OPS-02-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Operations activities have identified owners responsible for their performance</strong> - Understand who has responsibility to perform specific activities on defined workloads and why that responsibility exists. Understanding who has responsibility to perform activities informs who will conduct the activity, validate the result, and provide feedback to the owner of the activity.

   4. <a name="OPS-02-04-"><tt>OPS-02-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Team members know what they are responsible for</strong> - Understanding the responsibilities of each role and how they contribute to business outcomes informs the prioritization of tasks and why each role is important. This enables team members to recognize needs and respond appropriately.

   5. <a name="OPS-02-05-"><tt>OPS-02-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Mechanisms exist to identify responsibility and ownership</strong> - Where no individual or team is identified, there are defined escalation paths to someone with the authority to assign ownership or plan for that need to be addressed.

   6. <a name="OPS-02-06-"><tt>OPS-02-06-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Mechanisms exist to request additions, changes, and exceptions</strong> - You are able to make requests to owners of processes, procedures, and resources. Make informed decisions to approve requests where viable and determined to be appropriate after an evaluation of benefits and risks.

   7. <a name="OPS-02-07-"><tt>OPS-02-07-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Responsibilities between teams are predefined or negotiated</strong> - There are defined or negotiated agreements between teams describing how they work with and support each other (for example, response times, service objectives, or service agreements). Understanding the impact of the teams’ work on business outcomes, and the outcomes of other teams and organizations, informs the prioritization of their tasks and enables them to respond appropriately.
   

   <a name="OrgCulture2Outcome"></a>

### 3. How does <strong>organizational culture</strong> support business outcomes?

   1. <a name="OPS-03-01-"><tt>OPS-03-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Executive Sponsorship</strong> - Senior leadership clearly sets expectations for the organization and evaluates success. Senior leadership is the sponsor, advocate, and driver for the adoption of best practices and evolution of the organization

   2. <a name="OPS-03-02-"><tt>OPS-03-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Team members are empowered to take action when outcomes are at risk</strong> - The workload owner has defined guidance and scope empowering team members to respond when outcomes are at risk. Escalation mechanisms are used to get direction when events are outside of the defined scope.

   3. <a name="OPS-03-03-"><tt>OPS-03-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Escalation is encouraged</strong> - Team members have mechanisms and are encouraged to escalate concerns to decision makers and stakeholders if they believe outcomes are at risk. Escalation should be performed early and often so that risks can be identified, and prevented from causing incidents.
   
   4. <a name="OPS-03-04-"><tt>OPS-03-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Communications are timely, clear, and actionable</strong> - Mechanisms exist and are used to provide timely notice to team members of known risks and planned events. Necessary context, details, and time (when possible) are provided to support determining if action is necessary, what action is required, and to take action in a timely manner. For example, providing notice of software vulnerabilities so that patching can be expedited, or providing notice of planned sales promotions so that a change freeze can be implemented to avoid the risk of service disruption.

   5. <a name="OPS-03-05-"><tt>OPS-03-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Experimentation is encouraged</strong> - Experimentation accelerates learning and keeps team members interested and engaged. An undesired result is a successful experiment that has identified a path that will not lead to success. Team members are not punished for successful experiments with undesired results. Experimentation is required for innovation to happen and turn ideas into outcomes.

   6. <a name="OPS-03-06-"><tt>OPS-03-06-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Team members are enabled and encouraged to maintain and grow their skill sets</strong> - Teams must grow their skill sets to adopt new technologies, and to support changes in demand and responsibilities in support of workloads. Growth of skills in new technologies is frequently a source of team member satisfaction and supports innovation. Support team members’ pursuit and maintenance of industry certifications that validate and acknowledge their growing skills. Cross train to promote knowledge transfer and reduce the risk of significant impact when you lose skilled and experienced team members with institutional knowledge. Provide dedicated structured time for learning.

   7. <a name="OPS-03-07-"><tt>OPS-03-07-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Resource teams appropriately</strong> - Maintain team member capacity, and provide tools and resources, to support  workload needs. Overtasking team members increases the risk of incidents resulting from human error. Investments in tools and resources (for example, providing automation for frequently executed activities) can scale the effectiveness of the team, enabling them to support additional activities.
   
   8. <a name="OPS-03-08-"><tt>OPS-03-08-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Diverse opinions are encouraged and sought within and across teams</strong> - Leverage cross-organizational diversity to seek multiple unique perspectives. Use this perspective to increase innovation, challenge assumptions, and reduce the risk of confirmation bias. Grow inclusion, diversity, and accessibility within teams to gain beneficial perspectives.
   

   <a name="Design4State"></a>

### 4. How do you design workloads to understand its state?

   1. <a name="OPS-04-01-"><tt>OPS-04-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement application telemetry</strong> - Instrument  application code to emit information about its internal state, status, and achievement of business outcomes. For example, queue depth, error messages, and response times. Use this information to determine when a response is required.

   2. <a name="OPS-04-02-"><tt>OPS-04-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement and configure workload telemetry</strong> - Design and configure workloads to emit information about its internal state and current status. For example, API call volume, HTTP status codes, and scaling events. Use this information to help determine when a response is required.

   3. <a name="OPS-04-03-"><tt>OPS-04-03-</tt></a><br /><br />

   <strong>Define a process for architectural choices</strong> - Use internal experience and knowledge of the cloud, or external resources such as published use cases, relevant documentation, or whitepapers to define a process to choose resources and services. You should define a process that encourages experimentation and benchmarking with the services that could be used by workloads.

   3. <a name="PERF-01-03-"><tt>PERF-01-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Factor cost requirements into decisions</strong> - Workloads often have cost requirements for operation. Use internal cost controls to select resource types and sizes based on predicted resource need.

   4. <a name="PERF-01-04-"><tt>PERF-01-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use policies or reference architectures</strong> - Maximize performance and efficiency by evaluating internal policies and existing reference architectures and using analysis to select services and configurations for each workload.

   5. <a name="PERF-01-05-"><tt>PERF-01-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use guidance from cloud providers or partners</strong> - Use cloud company resources, such as solutions architects, professional services, or an appropriate partner to guide decisions. These resources can help review and improve the architecture for optimal performance.

   6. <a name="PERF-01-06-"><tt>PERF-01-06-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Benchmark existing workloads</strong> - Benchmark the performance of an existing workload to understand how it performs on the cloud. Use the data collected from benchmarks to drive architectural decisions.

   7. <a name="PERF-01-07-"><tt>PERF-01-07-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Load test workloads</strong> - Deploy the latest workload architecture on the cloud using different resource types and sizes. Monitor the deployment to capture performance metrics that identify bottlenecks or excess capacity. Use this performance information to design or improve architecture and resource selection.
   

   <a name="SelectSolution"></a>

### 2. How do you select the compute solution?

   1. <a name="PERF-02-01-"><tt>PERF-02-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Evaluate the available compute options</strong> - Understand the performance characteristics of the compute-related options available to you. Know how instances, containers, and functions work, and what advantages, or disadvantages, they bring to  workloads.

   2. <a name="PERF-02-02-"><tt>PERF-02-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Understand the available compute configuration options</strong> - Understand how various options complement workloads, and which configuration options are best for the system. Examples of these options include instance family, sizes, features (GPU, I/O), function sizes, container instances, and single versus multi-tenancy.

   3. <a name="PERF-02-03-"><tt>PERF-02-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Collect compute-related metrics</strong> - One of the best ways to understand how compute systems are performing is to record and track the <strong>true utilization of various resources</strong>. This data can be used to make more accurate determinations about resource requirements.

   4. <a name="PERF-02-04-"><tt>PERF-02-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Determine the required configuration by right-sizing</strong> - Analyze the various <strong>performance characteristics</strong> of each workload and how these characteristics relate to memory, network, and CPU usage. Use this data to choose resources that best match each workload's profile. For example, a memory-intensive workload, such as a database, could be served best by the r-family of instances. However, a bursting workload can benefit more from an elastic container system.

   5. <a name="PERF-02-05-"><tt>PERF-02-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use the available elasticity of resources</strong> - The cloud provides the flexibility to expand or reduce resources dynamically through a variety of mechanisms to meet changes in demand. Combined with compute-related metrics, a workload can automatically respond to changes and utilize the optimal set of resources to achieve its goal.

   6. <a name="PERF-02-06-"><tt>PERF-02-06-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Re-evaluate compute needs based on metrics</strong> - Use system-1. [<a target="_blank" href="#Terraform">Terraform</a>] metrics to identify the behavior and requirements of  workloads over time. Evaluate workload needs by comparing the available resources with these requirements and make changes to  compute environment to best match each workload's profile. For example, over time a system might be observed to be more memory-intensive than initially thought, so moving to a different instance family or size could improve both performance and efficiency.

   2. <a name="PERF-04-02-"><tt>PERF-04-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Evaluate the available options</strong> - Evaluate the services and storage options that are available as part of the selection process for each workload's storage mechanisms. Understand how, and when, to use a given service or system for data storage. Learn about available configuration options that can optimize database performance or efficiency, such as provisioned IOPs, memory and compute resources, and caching.

   3. <a name="PERF-04-03-"><tt>PERF-04-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Collect and record database performance metrics</strong> - Use tools, libraries, and systems that record performance measurements related to database performance.

### 5. How do you configure networking solutions?

   1. <a name="PERF-05-01-"><tt>PERF-05-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Understand how networking impacts performance</strong> - Analyze and understand how network-related decisions impact workload performance. For example, network latency often impacts the user experience, and using the wrong protocols can starve network capacity through excessive overhead.

   2. <a name="PERF-05-02-"><tt>PERF-05-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Evaluate available networking features</strong> - Evaluate networking features in the cloud that may increase performance. Measure the impact of these features through testing, metrics, and analysis. For example, take advantage of network- features that are available to reduce latency, network distance, or jitter.

   3. <a name="PERF-05-03-"><tt>PERF-05-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Choose appropriately sized dedicated connectivity or VPN for hybrid workloads</strong> - When there is a requirement for on-premise communication, ensure that you have adequate bandwidth for workload performance. Based on bandwidth requirements, a single dedicated connection or a single VPN might not be enough, and you must enable traffic load balancing across multiple connections.

   4. <a name="PERF-05-04-"><tt>PERF-05-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Leverage load-balancing and encryption offloading</strong> - Distribute traffic across multiple resources or services to allow each workload to take advantage of the elasticity that the cloud provides. You can also use load balancing for offloading encryption termination to improve performance and to manage and route traffic effectively.

   5. <a name="PERF-05-05-"><tt>PERF-05-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Choose network protocols to improve performance</strong> - Make decisions about protocols for communication between systems and networks based on the impact to the workload’s performance.

   <strong>Choose each workload’s location based on network requirements</strong> - Use the cloud location options available to reduce network latency or improve throughput. Utilize AWS Regions, Availability Zones, placement groups, and edge locations such as Outposts, Local Regions, and Wavelength, to reduce network latency or improve throughput.

   7. <a name="PERF-05-07-"><tt>PERF-05-07-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Optimize network configuration based on metrics</strong> - Use collected and analyzed data to make informed decisions about optimizing network configuration. Measure the impact of those changes and use the impact measurements to make future decisions.
   

   <a name="EvolveWorkload"></a>

6. How do you evolve each workload to take advantage of new releases?

   1. <a name="PERF-06-01-"><tt>PERF-06-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Stay up-to-date on new resources and services</strong> - Evaluate ways to improve performance as new services, design patterns, and product offerings become available. Determine which of these could improve performance or increase the efficiency of the workload through ad-hoc evaluation, internal discussion, or external analysis.

   2. <a name="PERF-06-02-"><tt>PERF-06-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Define a process to improve workload performance</strong> - Evaluate new services, design patterns, resource types, and configurations as they become available. For example, run existing performance tests on new instance offerings to determine their potential to improve the workload.

   1. <a name="PERF-06-03-"><tt>PERF-06-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Evolve workload performance over time</strong> - As an organization, use the information gathered through the evaluation process to actively drive adoption of new services or resources when they become available.
   

   <a name="MonitorResourceForPerf"></a>

7. How do you monitor resources to ensure they are performing?

   1. <a name="PERF-07-01-"><tt>PERF-07-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Record performance-related metrics</strong> - Use a monitoring and observability service to record performance-related metrics. For example, record database transactions, slow queries, I/O latency, HTTP request throughput, service latency, or other key data.

   2. <a name="PERF-07-02-"><tt>PERF-07-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Analyze metrics when events or incidents occur</strong> - In response to (or during) an event or incident, use monitoring dashboards or reports to understand and diagnose the impact. These views provide insight into which portions of the workload are not performing as expected.

   3. <a name="PERF-07-03-"><tt>PERF-07-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure workload performance</strong> - Identify the KPIs that indicate whether the workload is performing as intended. For example, an API-based workload might use overall response latency as an indication of overall performance, and an e-commerce site might choose to use the number of purchases as its KPI.

   4. <a name="PERF-07-04-"><tt>PERF-07-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use monitoring to generate alarm-based notifications</strong> - Using the performance-related key performance indicators (KPIs) that you defined, use a monitoring system that generates alarms automatically when these measurements are outside expected boundaries.

   5. <a name="PERF-07-05-"><tt>PERF-07-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Review metrics at regular intervals</strong> - As routine maintenance, or in response to events or incidents, review which metrics are collected. Use these reviews to identify which metrics were key in addressing issues and which additional metrics, if they were being tracked, would help to identify, address, or prevent issues.

   6. <a name="PERF-07-06-"><tt>PERF-07-06-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Monitor and alarm proactively</strong> - Use key performance indicators (KPIs), combined with monitoring and alerting systems, to proactively address performance-related issues. Use alarms to trigger automated actions to remediate issues where possible. Escalate the alarm to those able to respond if automated response is not possible. For example, you may have a system that can predict expected key performance indicators (KPI) values and alarm when they breach certain thresholds, or a tool that can automatically halt or roll back deployments if KPIs are outside of expected values.
   

   <a name="UsePerfTradeoffs"></a>

8. How do you use tradeoffs to improve performance?

   1. <a name="PERF-08-01-"><tt>PERF-08-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Understand the areas where performance is most critical</strong> - Understand and identify areas where increasing the performance of the workload will have a positive impact on efficiency or customer experience. For example, a website that has a large amount of customer interaction can benefit from using edge services to move content delivery closer to customers.
   
   2. <a name="PERF-08-02-"><tt>PERF-08-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Learn about design patterns and services</strong> - Research and understand the various design patterns and services that help improve workload performance. As part of the analysis, identify what you could trade to achieve higher performance. For example, using a cache service can help to reduce the load placed on database systems; however, it requires some engineering to implement safe caching or possible introduction of eventual consistency in some areas.

   3. <a name="PERF-08-03-"><tt>PERF-08-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Identify how tradeoffs impact customers and efficiency</strong> - When evaluating performance-related improvements, determine which choices will impact customers and workload efficiency. For example, if using a key-value data store increases system performance, it is important to evaluate how the eventually consistent nature of it will impact customers.

   4. <a name="PERF-08-04-"><tt>PERF-08-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Measure the impact of performance improvements</strong> - As changes are made to improve performance, evaluate the collected metrics and data. Use this information to determine impact that the performance improvement had on the workload, the workload’s components, and customers. This measurement helps you understand the improvements that result from the tradeoff, and helps you determine if any negative side-effects were introduced.

   5. <a name="PERF-08-05-"><tt>PERF-08-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Use various performance-related strategies</strong> - Where applicable, utilize multiple strategies to improve performance. For example, using strategies like caching data to prevent excessive network or database calls, using read-replicas for database engines to improve read rates, sharding or compressing data where possible to reduce data volumes, and buffering and streaming of results as they are available to avoid blocking.

   <strong>Decommission resources automatically</strong> - Design workloads to gracefully handle resource termination as you identify and decommission non-critical resources, resources that are not required, or resources with low utilization.
   

   <a name="EvaluateServices"></a>

5. How do you evaluate when you select services?

   1. <a name="COST-05-01-"><tt>COST-05-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Identify organization requirements for cost</strong> - Work with team members to define the balance between cost optimization and other pillars, such as performance and reliability, for this workload.

   2. <a name="COST-05-02-"><tt>COST-05-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Analyze all components of this workload</strong> - Ensure every workload component is analyzed, regardless of current size or current costs. Review effort should reflect potential benefit, such as current and projected costs.

   3. <a name="COST-05-03-"><tt>COST-05-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Perform a thorough analysis of each component</strong> - the overall cost of each component. Look at total cost of ownership by factoring in cost of operations and management, especially when using managed services. Review effort should reflect potential benefit: for example, time spent analyzing is proportional to component cost.

   4. <a name="COST-05-04-"><tt>COST-05-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Select software with cost effective licensing</strong> - Open source software will eliminate software licensing costs, which can contribute significant costs to workloads. Where licensed software is required, avoid licenses bound to arbitrary attributes such as CPUs, look for licenses that are bound to output or outcomes. The cost of these licenses scales more closely to the benefit they provide.

   5. <a name="COST-05-05-"><tt>COST-05-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Select components of this workload to optimize cost in line with organization priorities</strong> - Factor in cost when selecting all components. This includes using application and managed services, such as Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SES to reduce overall organization cost. Use serverless and containers for compute, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon S3 for static websites, and Amazon ECS. 
   
   6. <a name="COST-05-06-"><tt>COST-05-06-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Minimize license costs</strong> by using open source software, or software that does not have license fees: for example, Amazon Linux for compute workloads or migrate databases to Amazon Aurora.

   7. <a name="COST-05-07-"><tt>COST-05-07-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Perform cost analysis for different usage over time</strong> - Workloads can change over time. Some services or features are more cost effective at different usage levels. By performing the analysis on each component over time and at projected usage, you ensure the workload remains cost effective over its lifetime..
   

   <a name="MeetTargetsSelected"></a>

6. How do you meet targets when you select resource type, size, and number?

   Ensure that you choose the appropriate resource size and number of resources for the task at hand. You minimize waste by selecting the most cost effective type, size, and number.

   1. <a name="COST-06-01-"><tt>COST-06-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Perform cost modeling</strong> - Identify organization requirements and perform cost modeling of the workload and each of its components. Perform benchmark activities for the workload under different predicted loads and compare the costs. The modeling effort should reflect potential benefit: for example, time spent is proportional to component cost.

   2. <a name="COST-06-02-"><tt>COST-06-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Select resource type, size, and number based on data</strong> about the workload and resource characteristics: for example, compute, memory, throughput, or write intensive. This selection is typically made using a previous version of the workload (such as an on-premises version), using documentation, or using other sources of information about the workload.

   3. <a name="COST-06-03-"><tt>COST-06-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Select resource type, size, and number automatically based on metrics</strong> - Use metrics from the currently running workload to select the right size and type to optimize for cost. Appropriately provision throughput, sizing, and storage for services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon EBS (PIOPS), Amazon RDS, Amazon EMR, and networking. This can be done with a feedback loop such as automatic scaling or by custom code in the workload.
   

   <a name="UsePricingModels"></a>

7. How do you use pricing models to reduce cost?

   1. <a name="COST-07-01-"><tt>COST-07-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Perform pricing model analysis</strong> - Analyze each component of the workload. Determine if the component and resources will be running for extended periods (for commitment discounts), or dynamic and short running (for spot or on-demand). Perform an analysis on the workload using the Recommendations feature in AWS Cost Explorer.

   2. <a name="COST-07-02-"><tt>COST-07-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement regions based on cost</strong> - Resource pricing can be different in each region. Factoring in region cost ensures you pay the lowest overall price for this workload

   3. <a name="COST-07-03-"><tt>COST-07-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Select third party agreements with cost efficient terms</strong> to ensure the cost of these services scales with the benefits they provide. Select agreements and pricing that scale when they provide additional benefits to the organization.

   4. <a name="COST-07-04-"><tt>COST-07-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement pricing models for all components of this workload</strong> - Permanently running resources should utilize reserved capacity such as Savings Plans or reserved Instances. Short term capacity is configured to use Spot Instances, or Spot Fleet. On demand is only used for short-term workloads that cannot be interrupted and do not run long enough for reserved capacity, between 25% to 75% of the period, depending on the resource type.

   5. <a name="COST-07-05-"><tt>COST-07-05-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Perform pricing model analysis at the master account level</strong> - Use Cost Explorer Savings Plans and Reserved Instance recommendations to perform regular analysis at the master account for commitment discounts.
   

   <a name="PlanDataTransferCharges"></a>

   1. <a name="COST-08-01-"><tt>COST-08-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Perform data transfer modeling</strong> - Gather organization requirements and perform data transfer modeling of the workload and each of its components. This identifies the lowest cost point for its current data transfer requirements.

   2. <a name="COST-08-02-"><tt>COST-08-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Select components to optimize data transfer cost</strong> - All components are selected, and architecture is designed to reduce data transfer costs. This includes using components such as WAN optimization and Multi-AZ configurations

   3. <a name="COST-08-03-"><tt>COST-08-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement services to reduce data transfer costs</strong> - For example, use a CDN such as Amazon CloudFront to deliver content to end users, caching layers using Amazon ElastiCache, or using AWS Direct Connect instead of VPN for connectivity to AWS.
   

   <a name="ManageDemandSupply"></a>
   
9. How do you manage demand, and supply resources?

   For a workload that has balanced spend and performance, ensure that everything you pay for is used and avoid significantly underutilizing instances. A skewed utilization metric in either direction has an adverse impact on the organization, in either operational costs (degraded perform

   1. <a name="COST-09-01-"><tt>COST-09-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Perform an analysis on the workload demand</strong> over time. Ensure the analysis covers seasonal trends and accurately represents operating conditions over the full workload lifetime. Analysis effort should reflect potential benefit: for example, time spent is proportional to the workload cost.

   2. <a name="COST-09-02-"><tt>COST-09-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Implement a buffer or throttle to manage demand</strong> - Buffering and throttling modify the demand on each workload, smoothing out any peaks. Implement throttling when clients perform retries. Implement buffering to store the request and defer processing until a later time. Ensure throttles and buffers are designed so clients receive a response in the required time.

   3. <a name="COST-09-03-"><tt>COST-09-03-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Supply resources dynamically</strong> - Resources are provisioned in a planned manner. This can be demand-based, such as through automatic scaling, or time-based, where demand is predictable and resources are provided based on time. These methods result in the least amount of over or under provisioning.
   
   4. <a name="COST-09-04-"><tt>COST-09-04-</tt></a><br /><br />
   Decommission resources, entire services, and systems no longer required.
   

   <a name="EvaluateNewSvcs"></a>

9. How do you evaluate new services?

   As AWS releases new services and features, it’s a best practice to review existing architectural decisions to ensure they continue to be the most cost effective.

   1. <a name="COST-10-01-"><tt>COST-10-01-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Develop a workload review process</strong> that defines the criteria and process for workload review. The review effort should reflect potential benefit: for example, core workloads or workloads with a value of over 10% of the bill are reviewed quarterly, while workloads below 10% are reviewed annually.

   2. <a name="COST-10-02-"><tt>COST-10-02-</tt></a><br /><br />
   <strong>Review and analyze this workload regularly</strong> - Existing workloads are regularly reviewed as per defined processes.

AWS Design Principles for cost optimization:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/practice-cloud-financial-management.html">Implement cloud financial management</a>: To achieve financial success and accelerate business value realization in the cloud, you must invest in Cloud Financial Management. The organization must dedicate the necessary time and resources for building capability in this new domain of technology and usage management. Similar to Security or Operations capability, build capability through knowledge building, programs, resources, and processes to help you become a cost efficient organization.

   * Functional Ownership
   * Finance and Technology Partnership
   * Cloud Budgets and Forecasts
   * Cost-Aware Processes
   * Cost-Aware Culture
   * Quantify Business Value Delivered Through Cost Optimization
   <br /><br />

Others:

   * Adopt a consumption model</a>: Pay only for the computing resources you consume, and increase or decrease usage depending on business requirements. For example, development and test environments are typically only used for eight hours a day during the work week. You can stop these resources when they’re not in use for a potential cost savings of 75% (40 hours versus 168 hours).

   * <a target="_blank" href="">Measure overall efficiency</a>: Measure the business output of the workload and the costs associated with delivery. Use this data to understand the gains you make from increasing output, increasing functionality, and reducing cost.

   * <a target="_blank" href="">Stop spending money on undifferentiated "heavy lifting"</a> of data center operations like racking, stacking, and powering servers. AWS also removes the operational burden of managing operating systems and applications with managed services. This allows you to focus on customers and business projects rather than on IT infrastructure.

   * <a target="_blank" href="">Analyze and attribute expenditure</a>: The cloud makes it easier to accurately identify the cost and usage of workloads, which then allows transparent attribution of IT costs to revenue streams and individual workload owners. This helps measure return on investment (ROI) and gives workload owners an opportunity to optimize their resources and reduce costs.

   * Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership

<a target="_blank" href="https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/aws-cost-management-and-optimization-3567/">7 hr video course "AWS FinOps: Cost Management & Optimization"</a> by Oliver Gehrmann identified these strategies for cost optimization:

   * Right-sizing instances
   * Increase elasticity
   * Pick the right pricing model
   * Match usage to Storage costs

## AWS Cost, Usage, Billing

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.html">Docs</a>: 
<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-and-usage-reporting/">
AWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR)</a> contains the most comprehensive set of cost and usage data available.

NOTE: The <a target="_blank" href="https://calculator.aws/#/">AWS Pricing Calculator at https://calculator.aws/#</a> is used to estimate costs for specific architectures. Different server types have different costs. The same services in different regions have different prices. Transfer of data between different regions incur charges.

AWS billing reports are published to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.

1. REMEMBER: Click your name at the top bar for the menu to select "My Billing Dashboard":

   "Cost Management" consists of:
   
   * Cost Explorer
   * Budgets
   * Budgets Reports
   * Saving Plans
   * Cost & Usage Reports
   * Cost Categories
   * Cost allocation tags
   <br /><br />

   "Billing" consists of:
   * Billing
   * Orders and invoices
   * Credits
   * Purchase orders
   <br /><br />

   In "AWS Cost Management":

1. Click "Cost Explorer" to launch Cost Explorer for "AWS Cost Management"
  
1. For Daily views, in preferences, check "Hourly and Resource Data" which costs more money.
